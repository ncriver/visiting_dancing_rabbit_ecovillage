About this project
##################

This project contains an essay I wrote about visiting Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage for two weeks during the summer of 2012. I used the essay to produce a set of DITA files for a technical writing course I took at Middlesex Community College in the Spring of 2019.

Besides the original essay in RST format and the DITA conversions, it also contains the HTML5 and PDF outputs based on the DITA map and an iPython script I wrote to split the original essay into multiple files and convert them into DITA format.

For styling the DITA XML into other formats, look into XSLT: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_intro.asp.
XML-Spy is a tool Mark used. https://www.altova.com/xslt-tools
