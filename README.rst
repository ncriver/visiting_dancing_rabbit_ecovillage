About this project
##################

This project contains an essay I wrote about visiting Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage for two weeks during the summer of 2012. I used the essay to produce a set of DITA files for a technical writing course I took at Middlesex Community College in the Spring of 2019.

Besides the original essay in RST format and the DITA conversions, it also contains the HTML5 and PDF outputs based on the DITA map and an iPython script I wrote to split the original RST essay into multiple files and convert them into DITA format.

Location of Files
####################

* The main DITA map is named index.ditamap, and it is in the top-level folder. It has references to the relevant DITA topic files for generating the output.
* out/html5/index.html	and out/pdf-css-html5/index.pdf are the main output files.


Further Reading on DITA and XML
##################################

* For styling the DITA XML into other formats, look into XSLT: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_intro.asp.
* XML-Spy is a tool Mark used. https://www.altova.com/xslt-tools
