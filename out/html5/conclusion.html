        <p class="p">DR was set apart from the mainstream in many ways, and the mainstream could definitely
            benefit from studying it. What impressed me the most about DR was its car-free village
            design which made it safer, healthier, more sustainable, and much more social. The
            well-insulated homes that managed to stay cool without AC demonstrated that with proper
            design, passive temperature control is possible even in hot weather. Despite having had
            a lot of positive experiences at DR, I ultimately decided not to move there. Visiting DR
            helped me realize that the term, "simple life," which people often use to describe rural
            life is a misnomer. Instead of externalizing many complexities and discomforts of life
            using specialization, technology, and corporations, the people at DR had internalized
            them using their owns bodies, skills, knowledge, and social connections. Composting your
            own food and bodily waste, a task people in the mainstream would never do, were daily
            tasks at DR. Most DR members built their own homes by hand and maintained their own
            power system, skills most people in the mainstream do not have.</p>
        <p class="p">The people at DR were tough. I do not think they chose this lifestyle because it was
            altogether easier. Many people at DR had past lives working as successful corporate
            employees in urban environments. They could have stayed with the mainstream, dealing
            with long commutes through urban sprawl, wondering when they should buy a new
            car/phone/TV, paying mortgages on a nice air-conditioned home, and visiting hot new
            restaurants during the weekends. The people at DR had given up the stresses and comforts
            of their past lives for a challenging life in the country, experiencing physical,
            financial, and social challenges that came with working to create a more sustainable
            rural village.</p>
        <p class="p">I realized my motivation did not exactly line up with the tougher reality at DR. I was
            looking for a more leisurely life by living at an ecovillage. The visit suggested that
            living at DR was a complex mixture of leisure and challenges. Sure, people would take
            slow afternoon swims in the pond, but they would also work hard with their own hands to
            build homes and struggle to meet their financial needs. I jumped in hoping for a utopia,
            but I sensed that people were not always completely happy. There is a lot of stress and
            work involved in keeping a small intentional community together. I got the feeling some
            of the residents and members themselves envisioned a paradise and were feeling
            discontent with the messy reality.</p>
        <p class="p">Having had a brief but real taste of living at a sustainability-focused rural community,
            I was not sure if I had the right combination of energy and mindset to develop social
            bonds, learn new skills, build a house, pursue my interests, and live a sustainable
            lifestyle in a potentially isolating village of about 70 people. I anticipated the
            social aspect to be one of the most challenging parts of living at DR. I did not
            completely click with the people, and as described before, clashed with some. Another
            big deterrent for me joining DR was financial challenges. I felt I did not have enough
            money to take the risk. I also had no idea what kind of work I would be doing to
            generate income since I was only used to doing very specialized work in large
            corporations. </p>
        <p class="p">After some traveling and relaxing following my visit to DR, I ended up returning to work
            for corporate IT. The pull of Dancing Rabbit was not strong enough during my visit to
            make me want to pick up everything and move there, but the experience increased the
            sense of doubt I had about my mainstream lifestyle. Soon after returning to work, I got
            a bike and started biking more frequently. I had been composting food waste before my
            visit, and the experience made me stick with the practice. I also continued saving money
            in hope of being able to make a radical move when the time arrives.</p>
        <p class="p">The main takeaway from my visit to DR was that for our society to become more sustainable
            on a massive level, changes need to start where we are, not by building new villages in
            remote areas of the country away from already developed cities. As problematic as
            mainstream cities can be with crumbling roads, sprawl, low walkability, unaffordable
            housing, etc, their infrastructure, density, culture, and methods of production still
            have tremendous value. All the ecovillages, including DR, still depended on the outside
            world for essential supplies, services, and economic opportunities. The near-daily UPS
            shipments arriving at DR and people going off-farm for seasonal work acknowledged that
            dependency. Not only is it impossible for all of us to leave our cities and create new
            sustainable cities from scratch, leaving our cities entails giving up both their
            problems and strengths.</p>
        <p class="p">To clarify, the people at DR never insisted that everyone should pack up their bags and
            move to ecovillages. They viewed DR as an experimental village that would demonstrate
            sustainable concepts and practices to the greater world. A more realistic and practical
            vision would be for mainstream cities and idealistic ecovillages to exist in symbiosis,
            learning from each other and sharing their resources. I continue to wonder how
            mainstream cities would function if they adopted aspects of DR I found to be positive
            and innovative such as car-free neighborhoods, composting toilets, and multi-purpose
            community buildings.</p>
