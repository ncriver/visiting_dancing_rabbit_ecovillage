        <p class="p">Generating income while living at DR was a big challenge for many people due to DR's
            remote location. It was a common problem I would observe at other ecovillages since they
            were usually located in economically and socially isolated rural areas with inexpensive
            real estate that allowed for experimentation. DR was an income-independent community,
            meaning that members did not share their income with other members except for full
            members paying 2% of their income as a maintenance fee. The system was different from
            income-sharing intentional communities such as Twin Oaks in Virginia and DR's own
            neighbor, Sandhill Farm, that put all members' income into a pool and distributed
            it evenly among the members. At DR, people got to keep most of what they earned, in
            exchange for the challenge of being fully responsible for their own living expenses in
            an economically-limited environment.</p>
        <p class="p">Most people at DR did not have conventional full-time office jobs because such jobs were
            simply not available in the area unless they were willing to travel 10 miles or more in
            each direction. DR's ecological covenant allowed full members to only use shared
            vehicles, which was expensive and impractical for commuting long-distances. Since
            residents were allowed to own cars, some residents were commuting long-distance to go to
            their jobs in nearby cities and towns.</p>
        <p class="p">Some people at DR did not have to worry about income as much since they were retirees who
            were well-off coming in. Among the remaining majority who had to work for income, some
            popular options were working online or living outside the community for a part of the
            year to build up enough savings for the rest of the year. The term for temporarily
            living outside was called "off-farm." The off-farmers tended to hold seasonal
            jobs in tourism, agriculture, construction, etc. Some people worked as consultants and
            would go outside the community whenever a project became available. One member was
            working for a non-profit remotely. He had to fly out a few times a year for the job. </p>
        <p class="p">It was possible for DR people to support themselves with income from working only a part
            of the year due to the extremely low cost of living at DR. Based on the up-to-date
            finance chart on the DR website I saw in 2012, you could live at DR for as low as
            $3000-$4000 a year, and even less if you grew your own food. Having said that, deciding
            to build a house on DR land after becoming a member would still be a big financial
            challenge for many people. It could cost from $3000 for a very simple DIY home using
            salvaged materials up to $50,000 for a nice home built by experienced builders. The
            construction could take as short as six months to a few years.</p>
        <p class="p">The village had a limited number of local businesses, so not all members could earn their
            income from them. The most notable local business was the Milkweed Mercantile Eco-Inn,
            an inn and a tavern right in the heart of DR. It was owned and operated by a couple who
            had been members at DR for several years. A member who was a skilled natural home
            builder got a lot of business from other members who needed housing. Some members also
            got paid to run an informal preschool for the children there. A female member was
            struggling to start a general store. Her main challenge was a lack of capital.</p>
        <p class="p">As DR produced very little material goods and food on its own, people were very dependent
            on online shopping. I observed UPS trucks coming in almost everyday. One member
            bashfully commented, "If the Internet goes down, we would be in trouble."</p>
