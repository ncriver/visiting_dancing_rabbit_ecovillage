        <p class="p">The buildings at DR were powered by solar cells and mini wind generators. The original
            ecological covenant of DR required the community to be off-grid. Some time before my
            visit, it had made one major change by connecting to the local power grid. It still
            retained the spirit of the covenant by planning to put back twice more power to the grid
            than what it took in.</p>
        <p class="p">These renewable power generation methods had some weakness. The most noticeable problem
            with the wind generators was their high noise level. The ones at DR were about 30-feet
            high with propellers that were about 2-feet wide. These are only my estimates based on
            memory. The propellers made high-pitched whines during times of heavy wind, including at
            night, which I found to be very distracting. The solar cells, while being dead quiet,
            had one long-term problem: The lifetime of the solar cells and the attached battery
            systems are only about 20 years. </p>
        <p class="p">Since the homes were very well-insulated, people could stay relatively comfortable inside
            homes without using active cooling from ACs. For generating heat during the cold
            Missouri winter, people often resorted to burning wood, which creates problems with air
            quaility according to the members.</p>
