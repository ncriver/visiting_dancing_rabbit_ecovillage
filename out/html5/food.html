        <p class="p">Contrary to the common stereotype that ecology-focused intentional communities are food
            self-sufficient, all ecovillages I visted were very far from achieving the ideal. DR had
            several kitchen co-ops where people pay a monthly fee to share the cost of eating.
            Usually, it was around $7 per person per day. Food co-ops would mail-order grains, oils,
            dairy, and meats from organic providers in bulk. Most people at DR took care of their
            food needs primarily through these food co-ops. Sunflower was the main co-op at the
            common house, which was open to everyone while other co-ops were exclusive. The other
            co-ops had their own separate kitchens, and candidates had to build a rapport with the
            existing members to be accepted into the coop.</p>
        <p class="p">DR visitor program participants were assigned to a strict eating schedule where they
            rotated through five different kitchen co-ops. The taste of the food I had at DR was a
            complete gamble depending on who was cooking. Some meals were amazing while some meals
            had much to be desired. Most of the food I got at DR during the visitor program was
            vegan, which I had no problems with as I eat a lot of vegan food at home, but some
            dishes were simply not very flavorful. Since the cooks had to accommodate all diet
            restrictions of the visitors, the food was often reduced to the lowest common
            denominator: vegetables and beans. We once got to enjoy a meal of raw kale salad and
            unseasoned boiled kidney beans. Since members and residents eat at their own kitchens or
            their own co-ops, their diet would not be so restrictive. To be fair, we enjoyed some
            awesome dishes like vegan curry, baked potatoes with sour cream and bacon, and barbecued
            meats from a massive party. After finishing our food, we composted all leftover food and
            waste, including meat and inedible parts. DR people emphasized being careful with water
            use while washing dishes. Some actually leaked their plate thoroughly after they
            finished eating so that they would use less water when cleaning the dishes.</p>
        <p class="p">Gardening for vegetables was very popular at DR, but very few people grew more
            calorie-dense food sources such as grains, fruits, beans, and nuts. A few members had
            just started an intensive agricultural project involving food forests and livestocks.
            While the animals were happily established on the land, it would probably take at least
            five years from 2012 for the nut and fruit trees to produce food.</p>
