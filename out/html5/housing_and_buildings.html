        <p class="p">DR was located in an area with no strict building code requirements, so people were free
            to experiment with all kinds of materials and techniques. That turned out to be a
            double-edged sword based on what I saw. Many of the older homes were poorly built in
            terms of waterproofing and insulation, so the owners of these homes were working hard to
            retrofit them. The owners either built the homes themselves or bought them from the
            previous owner, inheriting their problems. I heard some horror stories of poor design,
            but I will leave them out.</p>
        <p class="p">Many houses at DR used 18 inch-wide strawbales as insulation and mud or other natural
            materials for the walls. Thermal curtains placed in windows provided additional
            insulation against the hot summer sun and winter heat loss. Skilled builders would angle
            the houses' awnings to block the summer sunlight when the sun is at its highest
            while allowing sunlight during the colder seasons when the sun is lower. Some houses
            used vinyl sidings, which seems an odd choice for an ecovillage. A member who is a
            builder explained that the ecological covenant has some shortcomings in requiring wood
            sidings to come from sustainable sources but has no clear requirements for other
            material types. Based on my first-hand experience, the homes had impressive insulation
            performance against the hot Missouri summer weather. When the visitors toured some of
            the homes in 90 F to 100 F weather, the homes stayed comfortable, if not cool, without
            using AC or fans.</p>
        <p class="p">Housing was where the main difference between being a member and a resident came into
            play. DR members had the right to build their own houses or buy existing ones that were
            available for sale. Residents could only rent houses, but could not own or build them.
            Since housing was in short supply at DR, only a few lucky residents managed to rent old
            buildings from members. Most residents ended up renting undeveloped land and living in
            temporary dwellings like tents or yurts. </p>
        <p class="p">Interestingly, members and residents could lease land from DR Land Trust, but they could
            not own any portion of the land. That meant even when members were building their own
            houses on DR land, they were leasing the land, not buying it for permanent ownership.
            This arrangement had the potential to create problems when members decided to depart DR
            for whatever reason. I did not pry too much into this topic during my visit, but in all
            the cases I had heard of, members who were leaving DR managed to sell their houses to
            other members. From a more cautious perspective, members who decide to invest their
            money into building permanent homes at DR should accept the possibility of losing money
            since the market for the homes are limited to DR residents and members.</p>
        <p class="p">Based on my rough estimate, most of the houses I saw at DR were less than 800 sqft, with
            some of them being as small as 200 sqft and a few being over 1000 sqft. Most of them
            were built with either natural materials or salvaged materials. I saw lots of variety -
            converted school buses, grain bins, cob (an ancient building material composed of sand,
            clay, and straw), straw bale with earth plaster, timber frame, and so on. Many members
            built their homes with their own hands using 18-inch wide straw bales from local farms
            to for insulation and load-bearing structure. After the straw bales were stacked like
            bricks to form walls, builders would coat them with plaster or earth plaster for water
            protection.</p>
        <p class="p">Looking at the intriguing homes at DR gave me an idea about schools offering mandatory
            courses on building shelters. Schools nowadays focus too much on teaching abstract
            knowledge while neglecting more practical and physical skills such as auto repair, home
            building, cooking, gardening, financial responsibility, and sewing. I wonder how society
            would change if education shifts more to teach these tangible skills.</p>
