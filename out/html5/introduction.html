        <p class="p">Hoping to discover the simple life in a sustainable utopia, I visited a few ecovillages
            over the years, starting with my visit to Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage (DR for short)
            during the summer of 2012. Ecovillages are intentional communities with a focus on
            ecological sustainability. Having been interested in sustainability and alternative
            lifestyles for some time while working in technology companies, I initially thought
            about becoming a farmer and volunteered at a few organic farms until I realized how
            difficult farming is. I shifted my focus to looking for sustainable communities and
            learned about DR on the Internet. DR is an ecovillage in Rutledge, MO that set itself
            apart from the mainstream by locally generating electricity from renewable sources,
            using composting toilets, building houses with natural materials, reducing fossil fuel
            consumption, and focusing on forming a close-knit community. For a period of two weeks
            from June 25th to July 9th of 2012, I lived at DR to participate in its visitor program
            for prospective residents. As a part of the program, we also visited Sandhill Farm, a
            small income-sharing community in the same town for a day. Immediately after my two-week
            visit, I stayed for two days in DR's sister village Red Earth Farms. In September of
            2015, I visited two more ecovillages, spending one week at Earthaven Ecovillage in Black
            Mountain, NC and just one day at Sirius Community. </p>
        <p class="p">While the visit to various ecovillages showed me inspiring ways to re-design our
            neighborhoods and our day-to-day lives, I also realized that the simple life is not so
            simple, and starting newsustainable villages from scratch is an impractical solution on
            a massive scale. Since I stayed at Dancing Rabbit the longest out of the four
            ecovillages I visited, I decided to write an essay about it. Another reason for focusing
            on DR over other ecovillages is that I had the most favorable impression of DR out of
            all the ecovillages I visited. I occasionally talk about in other ecovillages in this
            essay to compare them against Dancing Rabbit.</p>
