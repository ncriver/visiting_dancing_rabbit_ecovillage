        <p class="p">It became obvious over the course of two weeks that not everybody at DR got along. I
            realized I will likely clash with some of the people at DR should I end up living there.
            During my first day, I already had a run-in with a long-time member who dismissed my
            interest in yurts as stupid and went into an angry rant. He criticized yurts for not
            being well-insulated. When I suggested to him that Mongolians have been using yurts (or
            more accurately, ger) for a long time in an environment with hot summers and cold
            winters, he said that just because something is old does not mean it works well. His
            concerns were valid, but the way he presented them came off as rude and militant. This
            incident happened five minutes after I had met him.</p>
        <p class="p">Since people were living together in a close-knit community and sharing limited
            resources, conflicts would inevitably arise. One evening, a member angrily complained
            about the swimming pond being closed off due to the mens group using it to perform a
            ceremony. He had just worked extensively on his house, so his body was coated in mud. He
            wanted to take a dip in the pond to clean himself off, but was unable to do so. He ended
            up using the shower at the common house, leaving a muddy mess, which then upset people
            coming in to use the shower.</p>
        <p class="p">For being a small community, people at DR had a lot of variety in terms of personality
            and lifestyles. At the risk of oversimplifying, here are some of the different traits I
            noticed during my visit: relaxed, aggressive, monogamous, polyamorous, mystics,
            engineers. I personally found the mystical bent of some people at DR to be a bit
            uncomfortable. If I were to live there, the difference is something I would need to
            embrace. During my visit, many female members and residents were into Enneagram of
            Personality. A father expressed his frustration with this trend behind closed doors. He
            noted that in such a small community, there is a tendency for people to group think and
            trends can spread quickly.</p>
        <p class="p">One memorable incident with a mystic made me feel briefly like I was in a different
            world. An openly queer female wexer spread her palms over a watermelon and did some kind
            of energy-giving/blessing ritual. Her hands were shaking visibly from the effort.</p>
        <p class="p">On the opposite end of the mystical spectrum, I met a quiet married man in his 40's
            at Skyhouse. He was peeling carrots as he explained that he and his wife moved here
            after having lived in Twin Oaks for a while. His wife was working as a nurse while he
            was mostly staying in the village helping with chores. He later let it slip that he used
            to work as a researcher for NASA.</p>
        <p class="p">Not everybody at DR ended up staying there forever. People would leave for various
            reasons - personal conflicts, wanting to try new things, no longer in line with the
            vision, economic difficulties. One of the most common reasons for departure I witnessed
            was romantic breakups. Following a breakup, depending on how bad it was, one half of a
            couple would leave DR while the other half would stay.</p>
        <p class="p">Some people had trouble finding partners after they had moved in, which was another
            source of frustration that could contribute to people leaving. As a part of the open
            Q&amp;A session between visitors and members, a visitor asked members what they wish
            they had brought when they moved to Dancing Rabbit. A large male resident with a burly
            beard said, without any hint of humor, "A girlfriend." My impression prior to
            visting ecovillages was that in smaller and more isolated communities, everybody would
            have an easy time pairing up due to the lack of choices. I shifted my thinking as I
            observed cases of a few people taking most of the spoils.</p>
        <p class="p">I suspect the small size and the isolated location are the some of the main deterrents
            that kept new people from joining Dancing Rabbit. In such a small community, I feared
            that personal conflicts could magnify and people could at times feel like they could not
            retreat into their own peaceful place. There was a catch-22 in that the small size makes
            people hesitant to join, but people not joining keeps the community small, contrary to
            DR's vision of growing into a larger community of about 500 people.</p>
        <p class="p">Growth and expansion were hot topics during my visit. Since consensus system starts to
            break down in large groups, a large community needs to either adopt a modified consensus
            system composed of representatives or divide itself into smaller and highly independent
            units if it wishes to maintain a practical consensus-based system. People at DR were
            often discussing the proposal for a bigger common house and the need to update DR's
            consensus system.</p>
        <p class="p">An ominous vision I got during my visit was that due to DR's slow decision-making
            process, the community would have already gotten too big and too problematic by the time
            it had come up with an effective solution for expansion with everyone's consent. As
            an example, remember the problems I saw with the common house's humanure system and
            lack of thermal curtains, which had been that way for years.</p>
