        <p class="p">My favorite aspect of Dancing Rabbit was its high walkability, made possible by the close
            proximity of buildings, ban on motor vehicles inside the village, and a central parking
            lot at the edge of the town. Since the village roads were designed for people and
            human-powered vehicles, they were only as wide as a single-car lane. Adults and children
            could safely run around the town without worries of getting hit by a car. The high
            walkability allowed for more spontaneous interactions between villagers. Due to the
            close proximity of buildings to each other, going from one place to another often took
            five minutes or less. On one occasion where a truck needed to deliver a large load of
            straw bales to use as insulation for a house being built, the people at DR were flexible
            enough to allow the truck to come through.</p>
        <p class="p">DR's commitment to reducing dependency on the automobile was not without challenges.
            While residents still exploring membership are allowed to own personal vehicles, once
            they become full members, they must surrender their personal automobiles and only use
            shared automobiles as a part of their ecological covenant. Since DR was located in a
            very remote part of Missouri, this requirement severely limited the members' work
            options. A resident who worked as a nurse would commute for several miles each way to
            get to her workplace. Other members and residents saw this inequality as a source of
            tension.</p>
        <p class="p">After visiting Dancing Rabbit, other ecovillages I visited later sometimes felt like
            automobile-dependent mainstream suburbs. Earthaven Ecovillage, which I visited in 2015,
            was the opposite of DR when it came to transportation and street planning. Many early
            members of Earthaven opted to build homes far away from each other to enjoy the
            isolation, some being more than a mile away from the common house. One member explained
            that many members regretted the decision due to the distance making it difficult for
            people to socialize on a regular basis or help each other. Earthaven had narrow unpaved
            roads with no separate sidewalks, meaning pedestrians had to be very alert to avoid cars
            zooming down the road. Serious car-related accidents have happened at Earthaven. I
            honestly felt disappointed by the lack of foresight in an aspiring ecovillage that at
            times felt more dangerous than a car-dependent mainstream city with proper sidewalks. I
            wanted to enjoy walking around the village without worrying about getting hit by a car,
            which was not a concern at Dancing Rabbit.</p>
