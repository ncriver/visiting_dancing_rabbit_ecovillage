        <p class="p">Adjusting to the water at DR was a huge challenge for me. The water at times had a funny
            taste to it, and I suffered extensive stomach problems throughout my entire two-week
            stay. Based on the taste of the water, I think it was more than my body adjusting to the
            water.</p>
        <p class="p">DR only had composting toilets as far as I know. As visitors, we got to use the
            composting toilets in the common house and outhouses scattered throughout the village. I
            am a fan of composting toilets, assuming they are implemented well. Compared to septic
            systems and centralized sewage plants, well-designed composting toilets can be much
            simpler, safer, and cheaper. The problem with the toilets at the DR common house was
            that they were not suitable for large-scale use as they had to be emptied often.</p>
        <p class="p">The toilets were based on Joe Jenkins's system as explained in his book, <em class="ph i">The
                Humanure Manual</em>. The toilets were regular plastic buckets stored inside wooden
            boxes with toilet lids on them. Before using it for the first time and after each use,
            we would add sawdust to mask the odor, absorb moisture, and increase the carbon content.
            Once the buckets had become full, the content would be dumped at a separate composting
            site. </p>
        <p class="p">While the Jenkins toilets were easy to implement and use, they started becoming
            problematic with heavy use. The smell tended to be strong and with many visitors and
            wexers using them, they required almost daily emptying. Some wexers opted to empty the
            toilets into a composting pit at the bottom of a hill in exchange for some money since
            their work exchange arrangements often did not provide any income. The Jenkins toilets
            would work well for a small family, but not for a large community of 70+ people. A more
            effective long-term solution would have been in-situ (in-place) composting toilets with
            venting pipes. Private homes at DR had in-situ composting toilets with almost no odor.
            This discrepancy was another possible demonstration of financial challenges and
            shortcomings of group behavior at DR.</p>
