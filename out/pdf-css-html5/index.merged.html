                                <p class="- topic/p p">Hoping to discover the simple life in a
                                    sustainable utopia, I visited a few ecovillages over the years,
                                    starting with my visit to Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage (DR for
                                    short) during the summer of 2012. Ecovillages are intentional
                                    communities with a focus on ecological sustainability. Having
                                    been interested in sustainability and alternative lifestyles for
                                    some time while working in technology companies, I initially
                                    thought about becoming a farmer and volunteered at a few organic
                                    farms until I realized how difficult farming is. I shifted my
                                    focus to looking for sustainable communities and learned about
                                    DR on the Internet. DR is an ecovillage in Rutledge, MO that set
                                    itself apart from the mainstream by locally generating
                                    electricity from renewable sources, using composting toilets,
                                    building houses with natural materials, reducing fossil fuel
                                    consumption, and focusing on forming a close-knit community. For
                                    a period of two weeks from June 25th to July 9th of 2012, I
                                    lived at DR to participate in its visitor program for
                                    prospective residents. As a part of the program, we also visited
                                    Sandhill Farm, a small income-sharing community in the same town
                                    for a day. Immediately after my two-week visit, I stayed for two
                                    days in DR's sister village Red Earth Farms. In September of
                                    2015, I visited two more ecovillages, spending one week at
                                    Earthaven Ecovillage in Black Mountain, NC and just one day at
                                    Sirius Community. </p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">While the visit to various ecovillages showed
                                    me inspiring ways to re-design our neighborhoods and our
                                    day-to-day lives, I also realized that the simple life is not so
                                    simple, and starting newsustainable villages from scratch is an
                                    impractical solution on a massive scale. Since I stayed at
                                    Dancing Rabbit the longest out of the four ecovillages I
                                    visited, I decided to write an essay about it. Another reason
                                    for focusing on DR over other ecovillages is that I had the most
                                    favorable impression of DR out of all the ecovillages I visited.
                                    I occasionally talk about in other ecovillages in this essay to
                                    compare them against Dancing Rabbit.</p>

                                <p class="- topic/p p">Dancing Rabbit is an ecovillage located on
                                    the outskirts of Rutledge, a tiny town in a rural part of
                                    northeast Missouri. The main town center of Rutledge is about
                                    two miles away from DR and had 109 people according to the town
                                    sign when I visited DR. DR itself had about 55 members and
                                    residents - these two roles have some distinct differences
                                    explained in "Becoming a Member" section - and 15 children, so
                                    the total added up to 70. I also counted about 20 visitors and
                                    wexers, or work exchangers. Work exchangers provided labor to
                                    the host families in exchange for free food and loedging. While
                                    the population of DR sounded small, it seemed to be one of the
                                    largest and oldest surviving ecovillages in the United States
                                    based on my quick research.</p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">In 1997, a group of idealistic people, many
                                    from the West Coast, founded Dancing Rabbit as an ecovillage to
                                    explore more sustainable ways of living. They were looking for a
                                    place with inexpensive real estate and other conditions suitable
                                    to starting an intentional community, and Rutledge was a good
                                    fit. What helped the move was that Sandhill Farm, another
                                    intentional community, was already established a few miles
                                    away.</p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">DR is composed of multiple legal entities,
                                    including the educational nonprofit arm and DR Land Trust. DR
                                    Land Trust owns about 277 acres of real estate with four acres
                                    of it more heavily developed as the main part of the town. The
                                    rest of the land consists of undeveloped prairies, forests, a
                                    large swimming pond, and 20 acres that got opened up for farming
                                    in 2012 before my visit.</p>

                                    which would turn out to be a common feature in all ecovillages I
                                    visited except for Red Earth Farms, was the common house. The
                                    common house at DR was a large, multi-purpose building with
                                    plastered straw bale walls. People used the large living room
                                    for meetings, activities, and dining. The bathroom area had
                                    multiple composting toilets, two showers, and a few
                                    energy-efficient laundry machines but no dryers. People dried
                                    all their clothes in the sun using clotheslines.</p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">For intentional communities, a central
                                    community building where people can easily get together on a
                                    daily basis is essential in order to facilitate communication
                                    and coordination. It also serves as a no-cost social space with
                                    a roof, which is a refreshing departure from mainstream
                                    communities that tend to only have commercial third places like
                                    cafes. While most cities have libraries as third places free and
                                    open to the public, the main function of libraries is quiet
                                    learning and research, not social interaction. Experiencing the
                                    common house at ecovillages made me wonder how practical it
                                    would be to implement such places in mainstream cities.</p>

                                    hinted at DR's slow group decision-making process. Despite the
                                    village being about 15 years-old by 2012, the common house did
                                    not have thermal curtains while pretty much all individual homes
                                    did. Many people I met at DR said that changes can happen very
                                    slowly at DR. It seemed more accurate to say people were fast at
                                    making decisions on individual matters but slow on group
                                    matters. Since the common house was very uncomfortable during
                                    hot weather, many people without a permanent home, mostly new
                                    residents, visitors, and work exchangers, went to the bar at the
                                    Milkweed Mercantile, the swimming pond, or Zimmerman's general
                                    store in Rutledge town center.</p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">Rutledge and the surrounding areas had enough
                                    infrastructure for basic goods and services. The town center of
                                    Rutledge, about two miles away from DR, had an impressive
                                    general store named Zimmerman's, or Zimmy's, as it was
                                    affectionately called. The store had a small cafe that sold
                                    burgers and ice cream. People from DR would come to Zimmy's and
                                    spend a few hours just chatting and enjoying the cool AC breeze.
                                    About 12 miles away from DR was a bigger town named Memphis,
                                    equipped with a supermarket, a library, a department store, and
                                    even a local theater company.</p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">DR had relatively dense zoning for a rural
                                    town where some buildings were as close as 5 yards from each
                                    other. Houses tended to have small yards suitable for gardening
                                    while lacking a driveway following the DR's ban on using
                                    automobiles within the village. DR's town structure was based on
                                    what members called the “European model”: Homes were clustered
                                    together in a dense central area while a large area of farmland
                                    surrounded the central area. This structure allowed for more
                                    frequent social interaction and cooperation at the expense of
                                    not being able to constantly monitor the farmland.</p>
                                <p class="- topic/p p">Not content with this model, a group of
                                    former members formed the sister village of Red Earth Farms
                                    about a mile from DR. Former members who wanted to focus more on
                                    homesteading structured Red Earth Farms based on what they
                                    called the “American model” - each individual house was
                                    surrounded by a large ring of farmland, which allowed each
                                    household a direct view and access to the farmland. At the time
                                    of my visit, Red Earth Farms had what I remember to be four
                                    households. Rather than having a more strict ecological covenant
                                    like Dancing Rabbit, Red Earth held annual ecological audits to
                                    see how they were doing and what they could do better next year.
                                    Similar to DR, Red Earth Farms also had a central parking lot at
                                    the edge of the village, but it had no central common house. The
                                    houses were so spread out that it took several minutes to walk
                                    from the central parking lot to the nearest house while at DR,
                                    it took only a minute or so to walk from the parking lot to the
                                    nearest house. Although DR and Red Earth Farms were technically
                                    two separate sister villages, they often functioned as one with
                                    villagers frequently visiting each other. People from Red Earth
                                    Farms would often walk for a mile to come to DR community
                                    events. The following is a conceptual diagram showing the town
                                    layouts of DR and Red Earth Farms.</p>
