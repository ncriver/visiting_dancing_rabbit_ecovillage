                >Hoping to discover the simple life in a sustainable utopia, I visited a few
                ecovillages over the years, starting with my visit to Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage (DR
                for short) during the summer of 2012. Ecovillages are intentional communities with a
                focus on ecological sustainability. Having been interested in sustainability and
                alternative lifestyles for some time while working in technology companies, I
                initially thought about becoming a farmer and volunteered at a few organic farms
                until I realized how difficult farming is. I shifted my focus to looking for
                sustainable communities and learned about DR on the Internet. DR is an ecovillage in
                Rutledge, MO that set itself apart from the mainstream by locally generating
                electricity from renewable sources, using composting toilets, building houses with
                natural materials, reducing fossil fuel consumption, and focusing on forming a
                close-knit community. For a period of two weeks from June 25th to July 9th of 2012,
                I lived at DR to participate in its visitor program for prospective residents. As a
                part of the program, we also visited Sandhill Farm, a small income-sharing community
                in the same town for a day. Immediately after my two-week visit, I stayed for two
                days in DR's sister village Red Earth Farms. In September of 2015, I visited two
                more ecovillages, spending one week at Earthaven Ecovillage in Black Mountain, NC
                and just one day at Sirius Community. </p>

                >While the visit to various ecovillages showed me inspiring ways to re-design our
                neighborhoods and our day-to-day lives, I also realized that the simple life is not
                so simple, and starting newsustainable villages from scratch is an impractical
                solution on a massive scale. Since I stayed at Dancing Rabbit the longest out of the
                four ecovillages I visited, I decided to write an essay about it. Another reason for
                focusing on DR over other ecovillages is that I had the most favorable impression of
                DR out of all the ecovillages I visited. I occasionally talk about in other
                ecovillages in this essay to compare them against Dancing Rabbit.</p>

                >Dancing Rabbit is an ecovillage located on the outskirts of Rutledge, a tiny town
                in a rural part of northeast Missouri. The main town center of Rutledge is about two
                miles away from DR and had 109 people according to the town sign when I visited DR.
                DR itself had about 55 members and residents - these two roles have some distinct
                differences explained in "Becoming a Member" section - and 15 children, so the total
                added up to 70. I also counted about 20 visitors and wexers, or work exchangers.
                Work exchangers provided labor to the host families in exchange for free food and
                loedging. While the population of DR sounded small, it seemed to be one of the
                largest and oldest surviving ecovillages in the United States based on my quick
                research.</p>

                >In 1997, a group of idealistic people, many from the West Coast, founded Dancing
                Rabbit as an ecovillage to explore more sustainable ways of living. They were
                looking for a place with inexpensive real estate and other conditions suitable to
                starting an intentional community, and Rutledge was a good fit. What helped the move
                was that Sandhill Farm, another intentional community, was already established a few
                miles away.</p>

                of it more heavily developed as the main part of the town. The rest of the land
                consists of undeveloped prairies, forests, a large swimming pond, and 20 acres that
                got opened up for farming in 2012 before my visit.</p>

                >The interesting infrastructure feature at DR, which would turn out to be a common
                feature in all ecovillages I visited except for Red Earth Farms, was the common
                house. The common house at DR was a large, multi-purpose building with plastered
                straw bale walls. People used the large living room for meetings, activities, and
                dining. The bathroom area had multiple composting toilets, two showers, and a few
                energy-efficient laundry machines but no dryers. People dried all their clothes in
                the sun using clotheslines.</p>

                >For intentional communities, a central community building where people can easily
                get together on a daily basis is essential in order to facilitate communication and
                coordination. It also serves as a no-cost social space with a roof, which is a
                refreshing departure from mainstream communities that tend to only have commercial
                third places like cafes. While most cities have libraries as third places free and
                open to the public, the main function of libraries is quiet learning and research,
                not social interaction. Experiencing the common house at ecovillages made me wonder
                how practical it would be to implement such places in mainstream cities.</p>

                >The common house had some deficiencies that hinted at DR's slow group
                decision-making process. Despite the village being about 15 years-old by 2012, the
                common house did not have thermal curtains while pretty much all individual homes
                did. Many people I met at DR said that changes can happen very slowly at DR. It
                seemed more accurate to say people were fast at making decisions on individual
                matters but slow on group matters. Since the common house was very uncomfortable
                during hot weather, many people without a permanent home, mostly new residents,
                visitors, and work exchangers, went to the bar at the Milkweed Mercantile, the
                swimming pond, or Zimmerman's general store in Rutledge town center.</p>
            <p class="- topic/p " xtrc="p:4;30:12"

                >Rutledge and the surrounding areas had enough infrastructure for basic goods and
                services. The town center of Rutledge, about two miles away from DR, had an
                impressive general store named Zimmerman's, or Zimmy's, as it was affectionately
                called. The store had a small cafe that sold burgers and ice cream. People from DR
                would come to Zimmy's and spend a few hours just chatting and enjoying the cool AC
                breeze. About 12 miles away from DR was a bigger town named Memphis, equipped with a
                supermarket, a library, a department store, and even a local theater company.</p>

                >DR had relatively dense zoning for a rural town where some buildings were as close
                as 5 yards from each other. Houses tended to have small yards suitable for gardening
                while lacking a driveway following the DR's ban on using automobiles within the
                village. DR's town structure was based on what members called the “European model”:
                Homes were clustered together in a dense central area while a large area of farmland
                surrounded the central area. This structure allowed for more frequent social
                interaction and cooperation at the expense of not being able to constantly monitor
                the farmland.</p>
            <p class="- topic/p " xtrc="p:6;44:12"
                xtrf="file:/C:/Users/nchun/GitHub/visiting_dancing_rabbit_ecovillage/infra_and_zoning.dita"
                >Not content with this model, a group of former members formed the sister village of
                Red Earth Farms about a mile from DR. Former members who wanted to focus more on
                homesteading structured Red Earth Farms based on what they called the “American
                model” - each individual house was surrounded by a large ring of farmland, which
                allowed each household a direct view and access to the farmland. At the time of my
                visit, Red Earth Farms had what I remember to be four households. Rather than having
                a more strict ecological covenant like Dancing Rabbit, Red Earth held annual
                ecological audits to see how they were doing and what they could do better next
                year. Similar to DR, Red Earth Farms also had a central parking lot at the edge of
                the village, but it had no central common house. The houses were so spread out that
                it took several minutes to walk from the central parking lot to the nearest house
                while at DR, it took only a minute or so to walk from the parking lot to the nearest
                house. Although DR and Red Earth Farms were technically two separate sister
                villages, they often functioned as one with villagers frequently visiting each
                other. People from Red Earth Farms would often walk for a mile to come to DR
                community events. The following is a conceptual diagram showing the town layouts of
                DR and Red Earth Farms.</p>
